# maradns/deadwood Instructions

The following instructions assume the following:

* you are running maradns & deadwood on the same Windows PC as Gonespy
* your PS3 is on the same network as your PC
* **your PC's LAN IP address is 192.168.2.37 - replace this IP in all of these instructions with your PC's LAN IP address if it differs.** I recommended using a static IP address for your PC so it doesn't change every time you turn your computer on.

maradns is required to make your PS3 think that Gonespy is Gamespy by forwarding all DNS requests for gamespy.com and gamespy.net to Gonespy.

deadwood is required to forward all other DNS requests from your PS3 to Google's DNS servers so that all other online functionality of your PS3 works correctly.

## Download & configuration

Download maradns-2-0-15-win32.zip from [here](http://maradns.samiam.org/download.html)

Extract the zip file somewhere on your computer.

Edit the "mararc" file in the maradns directory and use these settings:

```
ipv4_bind_addresses = "127.0.0.1"
timestamp_type = 2
random_seed_file = "secret.txt"

csv2 = {}
csv2["gamespy.com."] = "gamespydns.txt"
```

Create a text file named "gamespydns.txt" in the same folder as the "marac" file, and copy-paste the following (copy-paste rather than type so that you get the right formatting, and remember to change the IP address 192.168.2.37 to that of your PC):

```
*.gamespy.com.  A		192.168.2.37 ~
*.gamespy.net.  A		192.168.2.37 ~
```

In the Deadwood-3-2-11-win32 folder, open the dwood3rc.txt text file and replace its contents with the following (remember to change the IP address 192.168.2.37 to that of your PC):

```
upstream_servers = {}
upstream_servers["."]="8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4" # Servers we connect to

bind_address = "192.168.2.37"
recursive_acl = "192.168.2.37/24"
root_servers = {}
root_servers["gamespy.com."] = "127.0.0.1"

# The file containing a hard-to-guess secret
random_seed_file = "secret.txt" 

# This is the file Deadwood uses to read the cache to and from disk
cache_file = "dw_cache_bin"

# By default, for security reasons, Deadwood does not allow IPs in the
# 192.168.x.x, 172.[16-31].x.x, 10.x.x.x, 127.x.x.x, 169.254.x.x,
# 224.x.x.x, or 0.0.x.x range.  If using Deadwood to resolve names
# on an internal network, uncomment the following line:
filter_rfc1918 = 0
```

## Running maradns/deadwood

### Quick Command Prompt tutorial

If you are not familar with opening a command prompt in Windows 10, you can do this by clicking on the Windows logo (Start menu) in the bottom-left corner of your screen, typing "cmd", then right-clicking on "Command Prompt" that appears and selecting "Run as administrator" (administrator mode is required for starting/stopping deadwood). Then change directory to where you extracted the maradns zip file to. For example, if you extracted the zip file to D:\maradns-2-0-15-win32 then you would type:

```
cd d:
cd maradns-2-0.15-win32
```

### Starting/stopping maradns

To start maradns, open a command prompt in the maradns folder and type the following:

```
.\mkSecretTxt.exe
.\maradns.exe -f mararc
```

Leave this command window open - closing it (or pressing Ctrl-C) will stop maradns.

### Starting/stopping deadwood

To start deadwood, open an administrator command prompt in the Deadwood-3-2-11-win32 folder and type:

```
.\install.bat
```

This will start deadwood as a Windows service in the background. You can close this command prompt if you want. When you want to stop deadwood, open an administrator command prompt in the Deadwood-3-2-11-win32 folder and type:

```
.\uninstall.bat
```
